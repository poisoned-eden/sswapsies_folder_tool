# sswapsies (`src/` swap)

`sswapsies` is a CLI that swaps the `src` directory of a React app with another `src` directory. No more copying and pasting into your practice app just to move on to the next activity!  

Useful for those on edX Coding Bootcamps.

## Usage

1. Clone repo and copy into 01-Activities folder

1. Navigate to the `sswapsies` folder and run `npm install` or `yarn`.

2. Run the `sswapsies` command in the terminal.

3. Choose the `src` directory you want to swap with the `src` directory of your practice app.

## Troubleshooting

The `sswapsies` command will be available in the terminal after you run `npm install` or `yarn`, but if you run into any issues, you can also run `npm start` from the `swap_tool` folder.
